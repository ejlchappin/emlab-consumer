# EMLab-Consumer
EMLab-Consumer agent-based model simulating adoption of appliances in households. The model is developed in the context of the EU H2020 project Cheetah, Changing Energy Efficiency Technology Adoption in Households. More information can be found here: https://www.briskee-cheetah.eu/. Results developed on the basis of this model can be found there.

This is a Netlogo model, which can be found here https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

A description of the model will follow. The model is complete, but some data have been removed (in particular household data from a large survey and utility functions developed on the basis of that survey).
